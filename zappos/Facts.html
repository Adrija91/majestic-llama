  <h2><u>Interesting Facts!</u></h2>
  <ul>
	<li><p>Llamas are known as animals that spit when provoked or threatened. 
               They can spit at humans also, but they usually spit at each other to solve misunderstandings in the group.</p></li>
        <li><p>Llamas have inherited fear of coyote, mountain lions and other dog-like animals. Some llamas are used as "guards" of the sheep 
	because they quickly alert and protect the herd when they spot a predator.</p></li>
        <li><p>Llamas do not have specific time of mating. Male usually chases female for up to 10 minutes until she is finally ready to mate.</li><p>
