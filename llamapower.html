  <h2>Llama Magical Healing Power<br></h2>

  <p>
  <img src="healingpower.jpg" width="300" height=150 hspace="5" align="left">
  	 Llama-assisted therapy involves fun interaction among families, couples,
   	individuals, and children.Llamas teach and model
  	 the ethics of community, commitment, family values, self-esteem, concurrent
  	 opposing feelings, and boundary setting.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Their communication is gentle, accepting, patient, and sometimes comical. They
  	are curious and joyful creatures and break out into dance and play several
  	times a day.
 </p>
 <p>
  	Llama-Assisted Therapy (LAT) can be helpful for children or adults who act out or have behavioral
  	issues, and for families addressing issues of boundaries and commitment. A
  	llama has learned how to walk away when appropriate and teaches humans how to
  	do that without losing face. Llamas teach how to be both committed to a
 	 community, family, or herd, and also express disagreement.

	Animals can help us to connect with our deepest selves.Holistic healing involves our
        relationships with all creatures, not just our
	individual selves, and just as Noah invited all species two by two into the
	ark, so may we work and live interspecifically to balance our society.

<h2>Llama Milk & Lactose</h2>
<p>
	Like all mammals, llamas produce milk to feed their babies, known as crias. Llama milk contains more protein 
	than cow's milk and goats milk, with 4.23 percent protein compared to 3.3 percent in cow's milk and 2.9 percent in 
	goat's milk, according to the Alpaca Breeders of Southern California. Llama milk also contains more calcium with 1,701 
	ppm as compared to 1,080 ppm in cow's milk and 1,400 in goat's milk. In addition llama milk contains higher amounts of 
	phosphorus and potassium.
